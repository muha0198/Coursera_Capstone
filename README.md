# Coursera_Capstone

This project was done as the Capstone project to the IBM Data Science Professional Certificate.
Having been equipped with the skills and the tools to use location data to explore a geographical location, the project involved coming up with an idea to leverage the Foursquare location data to explore or compare neighborhoods or cities of my choice or to come up with a problem that I could use the Foursquare location data to solve.

I decide on a project that focused on the reduction of carbon emissions in my city state of Singapore. The aim of the project was to use location data provided by Foursquare to determine the best locations for EV charging stations in the city of Singapore. Using location data from Oslo, Norway, analysis can be done to determine if there are determining factors that would make ideal locations. Such analysis will be of great interests to governments, vehicle manufacturers as well as service providers to strategically plan for the coming disruption of transportation trends in different cities.
